#Error Reporting

I am of the strong opinion, presently, that the only error message should be WAAAAGGGGGI!!!

Thee is always one W. The A, G, I and ! all vary, significantly. 

This is worth including in the core OS, though it may be headless. Probably not, as the user, too, should be able to cry out in anger and frustration, rage, victory, hunger, or simply to hear something loud.

The WAGI! may prove to be the most important thing about Orcs, actually. When you find a chip out in the wild and start poking bytes into its inputs, you'll probably crash it at first. Orcs, unless disguised, will say WAAAAAAGGGGI!!!!!!! if you provoke them. Thus, you know they speak Orcish. 

"Ey, Youz! 9 0 /"

"WAAAAAAGGGGII!!!!!!!!!!"

"Oi Oi!"

In practice, Orcs may in fact slap each other as a form of greeting. It would stand to reason. 

##The WAGI! Protocol

We need to use everything for lots of things, mate. We don't have a lot of words here.

Orcs know who they are, and what they are, and how to do it, and that's it. WAGI! expresses who they are, as well as what they are.

When an Orc is insulted in various ways, 'crashed' in Common terms, he will WAGI! at you. The exact WAGI depends on the flavor of Orc. Basically, it will read off its checksum (core check or library check), XOR it across the error byte, and emit a variable number of A, G, I, ! strings. 

Note that Orcs don't crash just because they didn't understand you. You have to actually tell them to crash.

So by systematically torturing an Orc, you can get its serial information, if it's that kind of Orc. Most are, until battle begins in earnest. Larger parties of the Possi will know a semi-standard (nothing in Orcish is standard) series of words to tease it out. 

By adding two instructions (dup XOR) to the error protocol, we get a reporting protocol, and have to add a translator to get the error back. That might be convoluted. I think it's still core to the Orcish way. 

Why? Because it's punk rawk, small, and moderately confusing. If you want to talk to an Orc, you have to know some Orc, because Orc doesn't speak, say, TCP/IP. Unless it does. WAGI! always means an error, and sometimes that's all you care about. 

Orc's core vocabulary will be about two things: fundamental computing, and I/O. Orcs are animals with the gift of speech, plain and simple. Orcs aren't viral: Orcs are bacterial. The core isn't about user convenience: the core is what it takes for an Orc to survive in the wild. 

###Details, details

Each letter is two bits, unless it's four. If one is four, they're all four.

Smaller Orcs, having a smaller throat sac and attention span, will WAGH! more briefly. 

###Four Letter Words

Why does WAGI! have five letters? Orcs can't count. Their earz also hear two bytes at a time. `WA` means you're listening to a WAGI!, you set the count on the A to 0 and start chewing. Or tune out; Orcs are very primitive and don't listen to jabber they don't care for. 

An enormous difference between a traditional Forth and an Orc: Orcs, if told to do something weird, do not acknowledge or dump stack. They just glare at you. Of course you can always program them to talk back: you could even induce them to automatically stack clear, if that wasn't such a weird design choice. 

Orcs don't see the point in dropping their task just because some other Orc told them something stupid. Orcs allow for a user but don't presume one.
