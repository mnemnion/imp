#Error Reporting

I am of the strong opinion, presently, that the only error message should be WAAAAGGGGGH!!!

The number of 'a's will be significant, the number of hhhs and !!!s may be also. Always one W and G. 

This is worth including in the core OS, though it may be headless. Probably not, as the user, too, should be able to cry out in anger and frustration, rage, victory, hunger, or simply to hear something loud.

The WAGH! may prove to be the most important thing about Orcs, actually. When you find a chip out in the wild and start poking bytes into its inputs, you'll probably crash it at first. Orcs, unless disguised, will say WAAAAAAGGGGH!!!!!!! if you provoke them. Thus, you know they speak Orcish. 

"Ey, Youz! 9 0 /"

"WAAAAAAGGGGH!!!!!!!!!!"

"Oi Oi!"

In practice, Orcs may in fact slap each other as a form of greeting. It would stand to reason.
