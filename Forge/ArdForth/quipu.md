#Quipu

The interlaced buffer structure seems...ornate. How about a Quipu?

Quipu are line-based, because our Forth discourages profligacy in communication.

There are two links at the front of each Quipu: one points to a line, and the other to a metaline. There's also a whole cell that has, y'know, headings, including the line count.
