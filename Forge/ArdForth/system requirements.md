#System Requirements

The entirety of OrcOS will fit in 1kB of Flash with no more than 256 bytes of eeprom. It will be compatible with the Tiny AVR, and fit in an Arduino Uno with enormous room to spare.

Uruk will be designed around an Arduino Uno, with no particular effort to leave room for other purposes. It will require 32k etc, though of course will not in itself fill it.
