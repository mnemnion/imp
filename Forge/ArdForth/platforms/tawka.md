#Tawka

Sometimes the chipz just can't be pwned. They might be ROM, they might be well locked down. Whatever.

It might still be possible to induce them to speak Orcish through translation. Which may be laborious, but if one can port the inner core, it's a done deal. You need an Orc to talk to it. That's a Tawka: it can be a program, either resident in the Boss or living in one of the Grunts, whatever's clever. 

Tawka's differ from Uruks because they translate Orcish into some kind of demented machine code. Uruks translate decent talk into Orcish, though clearly the Orcan programmer learns Orcish as a matter of course. Part of the point of Orcish: You needn't bother to learn it, but you might as well. Even if you start doing something weird like writing in it, Forge can translate. It's just butt-ugly Forth, after all.

Your chip won't be an Orc, but since your Tawka is you get certain protections. If the Tawka doesn't know how to translate, that means it doesn't understand, so it will just glare at you. Careful though: Ordinary Orcs can't be induced to barf their state and sometimes have other protections. The chip at the far end of a Tawka is even dumber than an Orc. That's really, really dumb. If it's smart enough to scream, you can at least get a WAGI! out of your Tawka.
