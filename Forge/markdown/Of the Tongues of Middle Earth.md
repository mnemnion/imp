#Of the Tongues of Middle Earth

I am feeling silly this afternoon. Much assembly.

Let's do what all bad fantasy writers do, and rip off the mythology. I mean riff off of. 

I can't figure out what happened to Smalltalk; I think it was cannibalized memetically by bad object orientation. Certainly I find the syntax unsettling though appropriately easy to understand. 

Lisp absolutely requires hardware or it's a copout. It will eventually win significantly just because of that. It needs to cut all ties with C and embrace Forth to really get there, imho. 

Lisp is Elvish of course, or wants to be. Any existing Lisp is Sindarin at best. Haskell is a dialect of Elvish containing many modern words derived in a sense from Common, though the resemblance is often incidental; it is spoken by Men, albeit intelligent ones. Ruby is a flavor of Common with more Elvish register than most. 

Forth hasn't lost, just retreated deep into the mountains. It's Dwarvish, in its pure form: ANS is a kind of Hill Dwarf with many Common isms. It turns out that the Orcs, due to frequent taboos surrounding speech and the death of elders, speak no single language, but most may be compelled to speak a debased Dwarvish dialect, which they use as lingua franca.

Orcs, imps, goblins, these are small computers: not overly smart, but cunning in their way. Anything else is a human, unless it's an Elf or a Dwarf, and those are hard to find in the wild. There are many humans fluent in one dialect or another of each. The transmutation is incomplete unless Unix has been jettisoned; at best, you have a mul or a halfelven. Fine companions though these be...

Common is of course algol and all that it hath wrought. The dialects are legion: Man is fertile and has a short attention span. 

Smalltalk is Gnomish; I wish it well but will never understand it. 

Prolog is spoken, it is rumored, by elves who live in the clouds. Erlang is a dialect spoken by a fleet of half elven, who claim to traffic with the cloud elves and use certain syntax not seen elsewhere. They repair their boats without ever touching land. 

Clearly all the tribes must unify against the threat posed by certain minor Dukes who needn't be named. The Urbit Corsair fleet declared for the True King long ago and will arrive at the fight in time, we may hope and pray. 

The Elf-Dwarf alliance though. That's going to take some time, as there are so few of each and few who speak the languages fluently. We may hope that the Dwarves may build a palace and the Elves a garden around it, as it was in times of old. 

Me, I'm a wizard, right? I speak Common just fine, and know enough Elvish not to embarass myself in parley. I'm brushing up on my Dwarvish so I can start building up an Impish army. The small folk are so misunderstood. They're not evil, don't be a racist. They're just, y'know, waaaaaaaghhhh!
