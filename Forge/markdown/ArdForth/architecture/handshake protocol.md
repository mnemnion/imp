#Handshake Protocol

Orcs are primitive brutes. They don't normally care if you're actually an Orc. It's just that they speak Orcish, and sometimes, nothing else. 

Being primitive, they stick to printable characters, even if they want to say unprintable things. 

The Orc handshake is derived from the Ozzies. I hope they find it amusing.

Hail is `wagi`, respond is `Orc!`, and it being Forth, we can have conversations like:

	wagi wagi wagi

	Orc! Orc! Orc!

	wagi

	Orc!

	wagi

	Orc!

I recommend this hearty form of greeting be used among Orcish users, at least when inebriated. And when is the Orcish programmer other than inebriated? Sleeping and dead, matez.
