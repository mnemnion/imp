#Error, Warning, Etc

Short note: It would be nice if the Fabri compiler produced a log with every output message it's capable of. Flags would determine which types of verbosity are displayed, not what's generated. Log files would thereby be consistent: the same code will produce the same log, regardless of the command line options for displaying them.
