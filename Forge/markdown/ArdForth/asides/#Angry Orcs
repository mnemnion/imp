#Angry Orcs

Core Orcs will not have the gift of anger. Some, perhaps many, will.

The principle of anger is that an Orc will happily prepare a think for you, but might not actually think it. First, it will check its spleen, to see how much rage it's feeling. Then it will take implementation-dependent action.

A simple use for the anger byte is password protection. If an Orc really gets hammered and the key is finally offered, it might be pretty pissed off. It might well take instructions and then send them out a back channel instead of doing them. It might even initiate hostilities, if it's a battle Orc.
