#Nerve words

Core Orcish revolves around two things: drinking and fu

two things: fundamental calculation, and communication. 

We have some important words, one is `huh?` which returns true if the low byte of TAK is in the printable ASCII range, space included. Probably a grunt. Orcish eerz and tungz don't hear or pronounce non-printables: The Orcish way requires that Orcish communication be readable by humans without unusual tools. An Orc is something you can send someone a tweet at a time; a powerful property. 

The core OrcOS doesn't expose a word to write to arbitrary Flash; most/all of Core is in the part of Flash you can't get to, anyway, but Orcs use their pak and don't generally like it when you tamper with. Battle hardened Orcs will hide their vocabulary in weird places; werdz that write to the gutz and splenz are too important to leave hanging out there. 

Also, Orcs can be told to be surly, and won't respond to input unless you say `WAGI WAGI WAGI` in which case they will `Orc! Orc! Orc!` and we're back to business. 

I take moderately seriously the idea that Orcs are organisms with important tasks. They might be driving a multiton forklift, or some part of one, and you shouldn't be able to fuck that up with noise on the line that happens to briefly resemble Orc speech. Anything that says 14 bytes of something, means it. C provides safety by being extremely stupid about anything but correct input; we do the same, in a different, more living way.

When an Orc hears a byte, he immediately turns it into numbaz and sends those two bytes back. That way, echoes will never collide with the command set. If he's done doing something, after a newline, say, he'll say `Orc!`. 

A most important word will tell an Orc 'recite to me the meaning of this word'. Orc only share core vocabulary in common; they are able to read through their pak, laboriously, and tell you what they do when they do a thing. Either in Orcish, if possible, or in machine code, if that's all they have. 

This word might prove to be one of the longest. It's absolutely necessary: if it can't tell you what's up, in plain ASCII, it's no Orc. It's like the `man` page of OrcOS.
