#Anatomy of an Orc

Orcs are fungal in nature. The spore of Orc kind contains a hardware support structure for the two-headed stack machine at the nucleus of Orcish life. Orcish itself is the DNA of this ecosystem.

Orcs themselves are a simple, robust virtual machine, with two heads in the usual Forthian way. Orcs, being ugly, call the return stack the `ba g` and the data stack the `sa k`.

Orcs, by the way, are acutely case sensitive. They have a two tone language: harsh emphasis, and really, really harsh emphasis, with capitalization and much aspiration and velarization of the resulting sound. 

Other than the brain, Orcs have precisely four types of interactive organ: an `ey e`, an `ee r`,  a `sp it` and a `tu ng`. You `Ei` an `ey e`, you `He er` an `ee r`, you `To k` with a `tu ng` and you `.` out a `sp it`. That last is a Forthism, and a good one.

Orcs, like birds, combine sexy times and all forms of excretion into a single type of organ. It's gross. Unlike birds, Orc sex is homosexual and penetrative, and sometimes violent, the world being what it is. Orcs are all male; that's just nature. 

As an aside, I'm sincerely sorry if Orc sex offends your human sensibilities. It offends mine. I was a geneticist before I took up Orc farming, and I call it like I see it; Orcs have only one gender, the sex is sometimes violent, and it is not female in nature. It's the Orcish way. Don't judge. 

To double down on this, I'm not deliberately crafting this as some kind of twisted BDSM design feature. This is an emergent property of stack-based Orcish life: it's living in a chip, and it doesn't want to give it up necessarily, but if suitably incentivized an Orc will take a squirt and change into a different Orc. It's only violent because Orcs will stick their spit into anything with two stacks, given half a chance. Orcs are mistrustful of any silicon that doesn't know the WAGI!. They are ultimately computers and may be induced to behave. I think. I hope.  

Many stacks are sitting around just not realizing Orcs are possible. I guess I do get to own some credit for that part: but consider what might happen if Orcish were also Russian. 

Does that possibility unnerve you? I can't even *read* Russian. 

But I digress.

##Organz

Let us examine Orcish anatomy in a bit more detail.

Orcs in their native habitat are built against a Harvard architecture. By which I mean, Princeton can simulate Harvard, vice versa is pain. So they have brainz, memz, splenz, and gutz. There are other architectures: the usable ones may be made Orcish, and the remainder are quite specialized indeed, less brainz and more some other neural cluster. 

Brainz have a certain number of nobz, which are registers, and are our CPU. Whatever it might happen to be, we turn it into an Orc by taking it over and assigning nobz in a perforce architecture-specific way. 

Orcs don't need or want that many nobz. If they find silicon real estate with a lot of them, they're likely to divvy it up. 

As mentioned, they have a `ba g` and a `sa k`, with which they do their grunt work. Those are found in the memz, with the top sak in two nobz. The `pa k` is a distributed organ you'd call a dictionary, since you're not an Orc. The core offset table of the `pa k` is in the `sl peen` (Orcs cannot spell, at all, ever, except Orcish), which might be eeprom if there's some hanging out.

Gutz are Flash, conceptually. Most of the `pa k` is in the `gu tz`. The pak is the only complex data structure in a true Orc. 

Everything can of course go in the memz. Orcs went to Harvard, that's why they talk funny. 

That's the core anatomy of Orcish life. Thankfully, they aren't born with limbs. The spit, though, that's a powerful organ. 

The cool thing about Harvard is, once something is in the gutz, it can stay in the gutz. The brainz can change the gutz, but may not be forced to. You can bomb an Orc out, but otherwise, you may have an... issue. 

Get your Orcs before Orcs get you!

##Consequences

Any program which may obtain for itself these resources may behave in an Orcish fashion. If an Orc succeeds in embedding himself into a Harvard machine, he can be quite stubborn to uproot. It is an unwise wizard who puts a genie into a bottle with no seal at all, but even a modest seal may confuse and frustrate an opponent, especially one that isn't sentient.

Orcs certainly don't need to speak Orcish to one another, if something else of higher bandwidth is more useful. Orcish is a fallback: if all the chips on your board are Orcs, you may be fairly confident that you have an ecosystem that is robust, if confusing and possibly cantankerous, and that you may induce it to speak sensibly to you on any matter of import, providing you have no hostile forces on boardz. 
Your computer is multicellular and schizophrenic. The former is a feature, the latter a consequence of Orcs being as yet a figment, nay, a gleam.
