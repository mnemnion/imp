#Speed Certificates

If you remove instructions from OrcOS, without changing functionality, you will receive a special certificate, telling the world how much time you've saved for a mega, giga, tera, etc. of invocations of your command. 

If it gets added back we burn it. Don't skin the cat, just give it a nice haircut.
