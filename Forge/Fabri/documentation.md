#Documentation

Fabri documentation will be Markdown, because I'm not fond of repeating myself.

It will work better, however, because it should.

Links will look like this: ` [link] ` and will point to the header that looks like `#link`. If you change the header, all links to it will change text. That's a hyperlink. Have you ever used a hyperlink? They're cool.

Links, links are not so cool. We do what we must, because we can. We can provide synonym links `[synonym](link)`, no problem. We can also parse a link if it's a URI, since we wouldn't do anything nearly so ornate on purpose. 

How do you get to links if you're on a frikkin terminal? To Control your Meta, hold down both keys. Meta is word movement and control is page movement, it'll make sense. 

Yes, we use the arrow keys. What decade is this? Get off my lawn. 

The codebase itself will be quite literate, in fact, I'm 90% convinced it will be a flavour of Marmalade. That would make sense. 

Markdown has too many options for my taste, so we will simply use the ones that I like. Subsets are good.
