#The Dungeons

An architecture is something you can look at and understand in that glance.

Our existing hardware are dungeons. Think of them as playable, and only inhabitable once played.

We're starting on the easiest level, and it's a solo quest. I intend to conquer level one myself, and then recruit. Onward!

True Confession time: Never played nethack, nor rogue. Some Advent, less than I should, I suppose. My earliest game memory, period, was an Infocom. 

I did play rather a bit of Moria, back in the day. On my first laptop, a Toshiba with an LCD screen that ran DOS respectably.

DOS. That was a fine dungeon. Many levels were ascended, many bosses slain.

We are not retro; we do have a certain arcaic style. In Moria, you have a nice safe town to wander around in, and then a dungeon. 

For us, these will both be Arduinos. The town is AmForth, and the dungeon is the raw device.

A raw device! Lights out, bats in the attic. Are there monsters? There are not. I rather suspect there are not. 

...Creatures, certainly. Misunderstood. Let us learn to speak their language, and then, teach them ours. 

##The Deep Dungeon of Acorn

Atmel cleared, and this will take some time, we may tackle the Deep Dungeon of Acorn. The ARMs are numerous, and powerful, and decidedly occupied. There may be Balrogs. This will be exciting times for the Possi. 

###Embassytown

Operations will be conducted from Embassytown, the home of all orphan environments. I run the Mac flavor. Do as ye please. Windows is of course abandonware; please do not bother me with your embassy problems in Shantytown. 

When we have a deck-class suite of chips properly rooted, we'll move there. Embassytown will get an embassy, just like it should be. Since we're gunning for Acorn, we'll get some jeejaws first. Hoo-haw! 

That's a big point of training up this kung fu actually, 'cell phones' are getting to be like lint and I want to pwn them so hard...

Mine anyway. This is all 'opt-in'. Though the Common world is going to have to accept, sooner or later, that Orcs are a thing. I'm not going to go around Orcing people, that's never been my style: pen testing is not a game I enjoy, so I don't play it, also, black vans with angry thugs. But when you have Orcs, you can Orc the funk right outta someone, and people will, human nature being what it is. 

##Moria

Call a dungeon a dungeon. The Intel core architecture has Balrogs in it or I will develop serious optimism with respect to humanity.

Thing about a Balrog is, you won't see it until something casts the correct magic spell. Then it will fearsomely pwn you. 

My sense is that Sauron has left the building: whoever wrote these Balrogs was sensitive and intelligent but was thinking about the Three Rings of Linux, Mac and Windows. You can't attack a superstructure that doesn't exist when burning an architecture which must. The Orcs are being invented after Moria was cast in glass. That's how we win.

Are they in the CPU? Probably. Somewhere on the board? I am confident. They are not likely to be numerous or easy to recognize: patches of unobtrusive microcode able to log, phone home, and corrupt encryption, specifically keygen. The last part is hardest to consisstently get right, the nature of algorithm detection being what it is. The former are easy, so that's what they'll concentrate on. 

I'm not a Balrog hunter. Perhaps Forge will assist some mighty wizard in this fearsome quest. I'm more about avoiding it; there are lots of chips out there, and I'm content to program them, and perhaps, occasionally, pwn their wards for access and knowledge. I leave the cracker hacking to the cracker hackers. 

Writing a full-suite chip pwnership protocol to pwn and operate an entire consumer laptop, like y'know a Mac? That'd be fantastic. Long term thinking is nice and all, but I have Orcs to write. I have three days before my dungeons arrive, and I'm getting excited.
