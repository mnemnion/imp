#The Orc Forthress

Forth was designed under similar conditions of adversity to those we face.

This is one of many reasons we've chosen it for the Possi. 

Chuck, like a good engineer, wanted to stay employed and do a good job. In them there days, every computer was different, and Chuck would carry his stack of cards from job to job, rewriting the core words, doing his thing.

C came along and we forgot all about it. Postfix notation, they said. Hard to read, they insisted. 

Now my own phone has a bunch of chips and does who knows what. When the Orcs get smart enough, they can take over a computer like that, because that's what Forth is designed to do: rapidly, elegantly pwn someone else's idea of good hardware, and turn it into a thoughtfully attuned tool for completing a specific job. 

C can't work because it's crystal and brittle. Lisp won't work because it's an idea, not a program, and implementations are mutually allergic. Forth is a program, not a metaprogram just a program, different implementations but it's a really good program so it can be the same program regardless. Stack is as stack does. 

Orcish is a dialect of this point of view optimized for interprocess and interarchitecture communication. To get all fancy for a second. 

The current cynical corporate plan with these jeejaws is to ship a bunch of same-same-but-different 'droids and lock them down by making 'firmware' that's incomprehensible. Then plug an API on and you have a phone. C can only get us into this mess; it can't get us out, and again, Lisp won't. 

How do I know? There's no bare metal Clojure OS and it's been 5 years, and there's no LoperOS, not even a small one. Call me when either of these changes, except you won't have to, I'll be jumping around and texting people about it. 

I like Lisp. I need Forth, and the relationship is getting mighty comfortable as a result.
