#Messages

The roon `@` intends a message. Generally, the use of a message expects a reply in Orcish.

We've met the Orcish Cheer, `W@g!`, which is more complex than it must be. 32 bits of handshake is the major justification, combining with the baud rate to make the Cheer utterly distinctive. 

`W@` is the slang the Orc detects. There may well be other `W@` operands besides `g!`, but it suffices. The `!` in g is of the nature of a command. `W@` is much like "welcome message"

The Orc replies `@rk!`, and `@r` could well mean "reply message", and `k!`, in context, means "I command you to reply in the affirmative if you want to, or just boss me around, whatever". 

The slang `@` by itself simply expects one operand, of any sort, and passes itself literally. `@ 0e45` is read off by the receiving Orc as `message 0e45`, for whatever that's worth in that moment. The spaz is semantic, `@0e45` is the slang `@0` with the operand `e45` following. 

Are Orcs Smalltalk objects? Yep. Very small, talking objects. Smalltalk on a single core is a way to give your computer schizophrenia, but I digress. 

Most of the rest of the `@` slangs are ways to question the Orc about various matters. 

## @k and n@

A general reply in the affirmative takes the form `@k`, while a negative is passed as `n@`. "Ahhh, k", "nahhh".

These are also our boolean values.
