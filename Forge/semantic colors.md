#Forge Colors

Fabri uses text, not color, to reprsent code. Forge uses color in various creative ways.

These are 'colors', I'm serenely uninterested in human interface factors at the moment. We're talking about numbers.

Background is "black". I'll just call it black, just like I'll call 'ordinary' text amber. 

##Syntax and Semantic Highlighting

I'm considering having two highlight modes, syntactic and semantic. Syntax highlights from the Forth perspective, semantic from the Fabri perspective. We'll do syntax first because it's more usual and hence easier to understand. 

Really, we'll want a few highlighting modes. Dynamic color change as a way to evaluate code hasn't been done to my knowledge.
