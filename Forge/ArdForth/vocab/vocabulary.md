#Vocabulary

Orcish is mostly about Orcs talking to other Orcs, and higher level Playas in the Possi.

There are a few absolutely essential words to make an Orc Forth complete. That's a higher bar than Turing complete, but not much. 

The thing about Orcs, they don't have to do what you say. But they'll understand you. That's a powerful combination even for a dumb brute. Not all Orcs are dumb; there's a lot of fast silicon out there, and stack machines, as we'll demonstrate, are a force of nature. 

You tell an Orc `2 dup *` you'll get a `WUT`. Orcish would be `2 D *`, because we never speak when we can grunt. An Orc who isn't feeling surly will have a `4` on the stak at this point. 

All the differences between Forth and Orcish stem from two roots: we care only slightly about reading and writing Orcish, and Orcs spend a lot of time talking to each other, rather than to a user. Also, there's not a lot of room, though by Forth standards we normally have more than enough space for a full stack. The Trinket is laughably small compared to the usual cheap 32 bit ARM candy that gets stuck onto everything. 

We use only that which may be cut and pasted. That's a core tenet of Orcish. 

###Orcish Dictionary

Orcs start with the oldest definition, and can't usually learn a new word as a result. That's a feature: Fancy backwards speakers are Dwarvish or worse, and not to be trusted. 

So Orcs don't use ASCII control codes, as a matter of course. They spit printable unprintables at you. 

###Orcish communication

Orcs can see an entire byte, but they can't hear it. Certain values are above and below their threshold of hearing: if a pin is said to be an `ea r`, they will only catch so much when a routine calls `ls n`. When they `to k`, they can only say so much, the threshold being by nature identical. An `ey e` can of course `se e` anything, and a `gr nt` can be anything. 

Typically, so as to be taciturn and save cells, an Orc will simply not hear you at all, and consequently, say nothing in reply. A clever Orc may hear you, and seethe with inner rage that you have addressed him incorrectly. 

Be wary of Orcs, my friend. They are contagious. 

###Wun Letta Werdz

Orcs of course have Werdz. One byte words are the core vocabulary of communication and use an eeprom offset table in compatible chipz. They have as much punch as possible.

###Two Letta Werdz

Anything else an Orc understands is likely to be two letters long. Mnemonic wherever possible, as with the core words. Longer words will be misunderstood as a more aggressive form of communication: truncation is not performed by the Orc. An Orc can `ls`, you tell it to `lsn` or `listen` or something civilized like that and the protocol droid takes care of it. Or you Orc at it. Your choice. 

These live in a dictionary: stunted and primitive, or surprisingly comprehensive and through. Many Orcs can recite all of Hamlet in the original Orcish. 


###Thre Letta Werdz

Fuk you, izz wut. Orcs mislike wasting a byte.

###Forr Letter Werdz.

Orcs often speak in four letter words. Sometimes these are five letters long, because orcs can't spell. 

The last four letters encode something, either at 2 bits or 4 bits. The first letter, if present, may have significance. Hard to tell with Orcs. 

This is not what you'd call the essence of Orcish, but it's close.
