#Error Reporting

I am of the strong opinion, presently, that the only error message should be WAAAAGGGGGH!!!

Thee is always one W. The A, G, H and ! all vary, significantly. 

This is worth including in the core OS, though it may be headless. Probably not, as the user, too, should be able to cry out in anger and frustration, rage, victory, hunger, or simply to hear something loud.

The WAGH! may prove to be the most important thing about Orcs, actually. When you find a chip out in the wild and start poking bytes into its inputs, you'll probably crash it at first. Orcs, unless disguised, will say WAAAAAAGGGGH!!!!!!! if you provoke them. Thus, you know they speak Orcish. 

"Ey, Youz! 9 0 /"

"WAAAAAAGGGGH!!!!!!!!!!"

"Oi Oi!"

In practice, Orcs may in fact slap each other as a form of greeting. It would stand to reason. 

##The WAGH! Protocol

We need to use everything for lots of things, mate. We don't have a lot of words here.

Orcs know who they are, and what they are, and how to do it, and that's it. WAGH! expresses who they are, as well as what they are.

When an Orc is insulted in various ways, 'crashed' in Common terms, he will WAGH! at you. The exact WAGH depends on the flavor of Orc. Basically, it will read off its checksum (core check or library check), XOR it across the error byte, and emit a variable number of A, G, H, ! strings. 

If you don't know what the error is, you can send it back, and the Orc, if it's not surly, will send you another WAGH!, this one standard.

So by systematically torturing an Orc, you can get its serial information, if it's that kind of Orc. Most are, until battle begins in earnest. Larger parties of the Possi will know a semi-standard (nothing in Orcish is standard) series of words to tease it out. 

By adding two instructions (dup XOR) to the error protocol, we get a reporting protocol, and have to add a translator to get the error back. That might be convoluted. I think it's still core to the Orcish way. 

Why? Because it's punk rawk, small, and moderately confusing. If you want to talk to an Orc, you have to know some Orc, because Orc doesn't speak, say, TCP/IP. Unless it does.

Orc's core vocabulary will be about two things: fundamental computing, and I/O. Orcs are animals with the gift of speech, plain and simple. Orcs aren't viral: Orcs are bacterial. The core isn't about user convenience: the core is what it takes for an Orc to survive in the wild. 

###Details, details

Each letter is two bits, unless it's four. If one is four, they're all four. Wagh!

Smaller Orcs, having a smaller throat sac and attention span, will WAGH! more briefly. 


###Four Letter Words

I want a fugly mechanism to do things slowly: like DOCOL, except headless and counting down. All it does is spit four letter words. 

Yeah. That sounds tight. I have this inkling that this will be core to the Orcish way. Orcs aren't fast. Computers are fast. Orcs are small and brutish and get the job done. Except fast Orcs. Watch out for those. 

What it does is jump to an address at TOP, and counts down 3 2 1 0, executing four words, then returns. Whole game. WAGH!

Why does WAGH! have five letters? Orcs can't count.
