Prologue: This is the first post, so I'm tossing in a micro piece of the intro.

Future Forth is not the name of a language, though we might have to call it that.

The name of the program I am intending to reimplement is Forth. The language it will use for all core work will be Forth. It will not be ANS Forth, though ANS Forth programs will most likely be able to run it. That's how Forth works, if you want it to. 

And so we begin.

#A Library of Forth

One of the problems I'd like to orient Forth around is the problem of language and meaning. The approach is well suited.

Fundamentally, Forth works right up until you have a program, which is more like a book. It has never successfully advanced from here. Sometimes the book is such genius that it almost seems like a library would be pointless. A library is never pointless. 

Of course, what C calls a library should probably just be a book, or a shelf of books. C was made on very small computers too. Both C and Forth suffer from the poverty of imagination borne of a skinflint upbringing; C++ is like an obese and entitled son who had it easy and indulged in the cocaine. 

The only issue with global hyperstatic is that without a disciplined way to do dynamics, they tend to break horribly. 

Forth is fairly well suited here, to defining a terse and literal interface around these concepts which may be realized in system-specific fashions.
