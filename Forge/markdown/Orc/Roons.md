#Regarding Roons

Orcish is a language. Computers do not care what your referent is, all bytes are created equal. 

In general, we choose symbols for their semantic utility, and aim to use them in a consistent way. Orcish is an aggutinative, forward-only language. To syntax highlight it, we need to know the effect of every word. In principle this can only be resolved by execution, in practice, Orcish is not so designed. 

Roons in particular are chosen for their semantic utility. The single roon form is the type case, and any two bite slang containing that roon should reflect that semantics. 

This becomes less true for argument slangs. The function slang consumes the argument, so it may be anything we find useful. Sometimes, we may overload the meaning of a rune for such a second purpose.

Paradigm case: We have the replies `@rk!`, `@rk.` and `@rk:`. Normally, `.` is a field separator and `:` refers to definitions. Here we use them in a more conventionally punctuated sense. Note that we don't say `@rc!` because `c!` is not a valid slang. We **could** accept this argument, and we never will because that's phonemically invalid Orcish, just as "ngnarrrp" is invalid English.
