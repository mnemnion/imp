Bunnie Huang [rocks](http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=3554) as usual!

Apparently your basic MicroSD has a ridic powerful micro all of its own. Win!

Since we just need a Forth dictionary, which is just a linked list mostly, we can just tags on dictionary words that mark bad Flash. 

I a word! This is so cool.

I will make an Arduino speak Orcish, and I will make a Flash card speak Orcish, and hook 'em up!
