#The Dungeons

An architecture is something you can look at and understand in that glance.

Our existing hardware are dungeons. Think of them as playable, and only inhabitable once played.

We're starting on the easiest level, and it's a solo quest. I intend to conquer level one myself, and then recruit. Onward!

True Confession time: Never played nethack, nor rogue. Some Advent, less than I should, I suppose. My earliest game memory, period, was an Infocom. 

I did play rather a bit of Moria, back in the day. On my first laptop, a Toshiba with an LCD screen that ran DOS respectably.

DOS. That was a fine dungeon. Many levels were ascended, many bosses slain.

We are not retro; we do have a certain arcaic style. In Moria, you have a nice safe town to wander around in, and then a dungeon. 

For us, these will both be Arduinos. The town is AmForth, and the dungeon is the raw device.

A raw device! Lights out, bats in the attic. Are there monsters? There are not. I rather suspect there are not. 

...Creatures, certainly. Misunderstood. Let us learn to speak their language, and then, teach them ours. 

##The Deep Dungeon of Acorn

Atmel cleared, and this will take some time, we may tackle the Deep Dungeon of Acorn. The ARMs are numerous, and powerful, and decidedly occupied. There may be Balrogs. This will be exciting times for the Horde. 

###Embassytown

Operations will be conducted from Embassytown, the home of all orphan environments. I run the Mac flavor. Do as ye please. Windows is of course abandonware; please do not bother me with your embassy problems in Shantytown. 

When we have a deck-class suite of chips properly rooted, we'll move there. Embassytown will get an embassy, just like it should be. Since we're gunning for Acorn, we'll get jeejaws first. Hoo-haw! 

That's a big point of training up this kung fu actually, 'cell phones' are getting to be like lint and I want to pwn them so hard...

Mine anyway. This is all 'opt-in'.
