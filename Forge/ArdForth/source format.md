#Source Format

I've... I've really never done assembly before. 

I'm going to have to get better with C and Arduinos. The cross-loader project already exists I'm sure. 

I need more 'duinos!

My instinct is that I should be able to package ImpOS as an Arduino sketch, making it inline assembly in a C wrapper.

Assembly always comes in dialects. In the process of writing this I'll get to know AVR language quite well. 

Uruk is going to want an inline assembler that works in Forthright terms. That'll be a happy creature.

Basically, I'll use what AmForth uses. I like those guys.
