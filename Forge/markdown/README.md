#Forge

Forth is an excellent language, which deserves excellent open-source tools.

Forge is a project to write one. 

Forth has always done many things with convention that would be done with type discipline in a different language. Forge will use those conventions to provide as much awareness as possible of the semantics of the program under development. 

Forge is envisioned as the heart of a rich ecosystem of Forth tools; in essence, Forge itself is a REPL on steroids. 

Compared to the computers Forth was developed on, and is often target towards, our development environments are enormous. We can afford to do inspection, reflection, rewinds, memoization, and all the other semantically-aware
manipulations we like: the trick is, we'll do them in parallel. 

Forge provides an extensive exoskeleton in which to build a Forth program that will run with the simplicity and lack
of waste for which Forth is famous. The tools you need to write good Forth are different from the tools needed for more 'traditional' languages.

Forge is mostly unwritten. Perhaps you'd like to help me write it?
