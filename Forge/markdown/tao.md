#Tao of Forth

## 0

The code that can be read is not the true code.

a name for a number is not a true name. 

the bare machine has numbers,

the mother of all programs has a name.

thus in simplicity we see the beginning,

in complication we see the end.

two different modes,

for a single machine.

the first we call Forth

dark beyond dark

the door to all programs.

Everyone knows elegance,
but if this becomes elegant,
that becomes ugly.
Everyone knows the good,
but if this becomes good, 
that becomes bad.
the empty requires the full.
when this is hard,
that is easy.
for this to be long,
that must be short.
high current is known by the ground.
signal requires noise.
to calculate from first to last
is endless.
thus the sage acts
effortlessly
and teaches
wordlessly.
not starting at the beginning,
not acting before thinking,
not claiming achievement
without claim
there is no calamity.

Absent honor,
no war.
Absent treasure,
no theft.
Abstent attraction,
no nuisance.
to rule, the user
empties the mind
fills the belly
hears the will,
strengthens the marrow.
keep the program free 
of knowledge
and want
keep those who know
from daring to act
in this way
rule.
